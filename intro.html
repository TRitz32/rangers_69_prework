<h2>My Background</h2>
<p> My name is Trent Ritzenthaler and I'm 37 years old living in Madison, WI. I've spent
    the last 10 years in the insurance industry but hit a dead end, wasn't learning 
    any new skills and didn't have the opportunity to do so. I wasn't happy with 
    my career and decided it was well past time to bet on myself - <strong>so here I am!</strong> I couldn't 
    be more excited to jump start a career in a new profession that doesn't have a 
    ceiling and always presents opportunities to grow.</p>

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>I enjoy playing as much golf as possible but I've already come to the realization my game is going to tank in these next 10 weeks.
    Outside of golf I religiously watch the Bucks, Packers and Brewers (especially when they are awesome.) I've got a few concerts 
    planned once this bootcamp is over that I'm looking forward to. I get up to my old man's place on Mirror Lake as much as possible
    and love to hang out with my nieces and nephews as long as I can give them back to their parents when they inevitabley start acting
    up. I consider myself the FUNcle. I lift weights and run (albeit under 1.5 miles) 5 days a week. Sunsets are my jam.</p>
